CIS EXAMPLES
============

These examples are common ways you’d modify ELMSLN to streamline some setup and integration aspects. These are marked ‘examples’ and not defaults because there are some things that may need to be changed in the code to meet your exact use-case.

One example of something that’s needed to streamline things but really should be allowed to be easily modified is the university / college / implementation calendar. This allows you to essentially map something like Fall 15 as selected for an offering, to the actual dates of that semester. In this way you can auto populate (accurately) the start, end, and course launch dates for a section by automatically setting these values to what the offering would expect.  While these can be overridden via other methods, its a good way to better own the platform in your instance by understanding how to implement it at this layer.

Think of these as a subset for streamlining the overarching implementation and network of systems, where as the other set of examples are some VERY implementation specific examples that are not applicable to everyone.
