ELMSLN Config - Stacks

This is where the files specific to each stackâ€™s implementation actually live.  Things that you always modify in a Drupal deployment like sites directory as well as the .htaccess file for the setup should be modified here.  The Drupal default is supplied as the default for each but modify here to have the .htaccess file change per stack.
